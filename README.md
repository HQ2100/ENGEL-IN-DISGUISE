# Engel In Disguise

## Motivation
We're driven by the pressing need to tackle the substantial demographic transition in Singapore, where a fifth of the population comprises individuals aged 65 and above, as of 2023. This demographic shift poses both challenges and prospects, prompting us to explore the potential of technology in aiding and enriching the lives of our elderly citizens. Our project is spurred by the aspiration to confront these challenges directly, offering senior residents the means to uphold and enhance their well-being, nurturing independence, and promoting active social participation.

## Aim
Our goal is to develop an application tailored for the elderly in Singapore, designed to enhance their quality of living through easy access to health and social resources. By integrating technological solutions, we aim to empower the elderly to lead more active, engaged, and independent lives.
